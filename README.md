Trend analysis is a statistical technique used to examine data over time to identify patterns, trends, or movements in a particular direction. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, marketing, environmental science, and many others. A very common and conventional method to detect trend is mann-kendall trend test proposed by Mann and Kendall. However, an innovative method, proposed by Sen (2012), is widely used now-a-days due to its simplicity and graphical features. This innovative trend analysis method is very sensitive and can detect trends that are overlooked by conventional methods like MK test.
